# pastebin_scraper
my first go project, scrapes pastebins every 5 seconds, there is a rate limit so try not to get blocked by that 

## how to use
install golang (https://golang.org/)
```shell
go get github.com/anaskhan96/soup
go run main.go
```
you may want to change the output file i put it at /tmp/pastescrapes as im on linux
